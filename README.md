# Virus Spread Simulation
Simplistic simulation model for the spread of a virus.
Made as part of a submission for the Singapore Mathematical Society Essay Competition 2021 (that won ðŸ˜†), this is a simple model for the spread of virus. 

## Scripts and files
**Unit Script** is the code for each "person". 
**TestSystem** is just a script that adds on to the UnitController script.

**UnitController** Script is code that controls all people and relevant factors in the simulation.

**GameController** Script controls the debugging side of things.

**Test.txt** is the original text file with all the test results that are not used.

**Simul.txt** contains most of the actual results used in the final essay submission.
